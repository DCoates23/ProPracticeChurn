# ProPracticeChurn

## This is a piece of work created in accordance with the requirements of the BSC (Hons) Data Science Degree Apprenticeship with BPP and involves a synthetic open-source dataset.

### Executive Summary

##### In the financial sector, customer churn is a highly relevant problem across banks as ‘keeping hold of customers is much cheaper for organisations than attempting to recruit new ones’ (Lalwani et al, 2022.) Therefore, it becomes extremely important to use analytical tools to gain an understand on customers and their circumstances and how different factors may make them more likely to exit the bank. Due to this, and a desire to improve coding skills in the technique, a linear regression model was selected to build the model and provide training to bring into the workplace, as the skillset can provide substantial value to the organisation, particularly customer service teams as ‘data can provide warnings about those critically close to churning’ (Gold, 2020.)

#### Another primary objective of this project is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to provide visualisations for stakeholders to theoretically at least, quickly gain actionable insights into the raw dataset, compared to having to go through a time-consuming process of going through a spreadsheet in its tabular format and gaining very little information, with a variety of graphs instead being able to contribute to a knowledgeable report and overview.

#### Furthermore, in building the model, it gave opportunities to utilise data engineering skills, data checks to ensure that all records were valid and reliable, so although the model ultimately didn’t lead to a strong R-squared score, it did give a reliable Mean Squared Error (MSE) score, therefore implying that the model could be used as a baseline to be compared with other models and a valid dataset to work with ‘making it a popular dataset for ML repositories’ (Rondina et al, 2023.) The result of this is the ability to discuss quality of data with stakeholders on a technical and non-technical level, and also give coders a blueprint to implement further analysis.
